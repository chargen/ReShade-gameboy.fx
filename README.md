# ReShade-gameboy.fx

Gameboy shader with checkerboard dithering for [ReShade](https://reshade.me/).

Multiple example screenshots can be viewed [here](https://twitter.com/kchplr/status/873810149231779840), featuring
NieR:Automata, Deponia, DARIUSBURST Chronicle Saviours and Enter the Gungeon.

The shader code is most likely not the most efficient or beautiful thing as it is my first time dealing with ReShade's
custom FX language, or any HLSL-flavored shader languages for that matter.

The shader code (Gameboy.fx) is released under the MIT license.
